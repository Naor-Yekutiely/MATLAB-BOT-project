# MATLAB-BOT-project
Implementing a Bot game algorithm. The main function of the project receives two different BOT algorithms and uses them to make a dual battle between the BOTs.

## How the robot competition works:
In the robot competition, two robots compete head to head on a virtual map containing fuel tanks
And bombs(mines).The game ends when the two robots reach a range of five units from each other:
at this point the robot that has more fuel will be declared as the winner.
- At each step of the game, the robot must decide which direction to move and which distance.
- In each turn, the robot loses fuel as a function of the distance it moves.
- If the robot has reached a fuel tank, the amount of fuel in the robot increases according to the amount of fuel in the tank.
- If the robot has reached the bomb(mine), the amount of fuel of the robot decreases.

The robot (robostrategy function) has full access to all the information about the game mode; that is, the robot knows:
- The location and size of each bomb(mine) and fuel tank
- Fuel condition of each fuel tank(if it still exsist or not)
- The opponent's current position and the opponent's current fuel condition
- Its own current fuel level

Each function (robot) is called in turn's and it must return a 2x1 vector that describes the movement that the robot wants to perform Next: 
that is, the vector contains the values ‚Äã‚Äãof Œîùë• and Œîùë¶. The robot uses fuel for its movement:
the cost of fuel per step depends on The step size - Œîùë•<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=^2 +> Œîùë¶<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=^2 + 2>

## Constraints:
The function (robot) is not allowed to maintain the previous state of the game. That is, all decisions about the direction and size of the movement are based on
Current game status.
